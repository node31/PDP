This is a complex Factory Pattern. As of now, I do not understand it completely or why it is used.

The following things I understand.

Client code wants to use some 2 or more items. These items are different but related in nature
We make an AbstractFactory, which returns these all of these products.
This class is one stop place to get everything. The methods in this class will give you all the objects which are
required

Now, there are factories for each of these products. They are normal factory methods or SimpleFactories.
We make these factories extend from this abstract factory.
