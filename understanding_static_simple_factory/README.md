**Static Simple Factory**
Static Simple Factory is a SimpleFactory with the create method defined as a Static Method

It is the most common form of Factory which is seen. It is very easy to implement and it also encapsulates
the object creation logic.

In my opinion, there can be no better factory pattern than static factory pattern.
